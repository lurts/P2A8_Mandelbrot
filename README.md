<sup>Zoomed in a little</sup>

A simple, multithreaded Mandelbrot set viewer with zoom functionality and improved contrast through a logarithmic scale.

---

## Features
#### Multithreaded processing
- the program automatically allocates a number of threads based on your systems capabilities to decrease render times
#### Zooming with mouse wheel
- scrolling anywhere in the picture will zoom in centered on your mouse cursor
#### Logarithmic scale
- I chose a logarithmic scale to make small changes more visible. It also looks pretty cool in my opinion

---

## Planned features:
- experiment with different scales and add a way to switch scales
